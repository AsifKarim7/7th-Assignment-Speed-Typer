            <h1 class="fs-2 mb-4">Question 1: Difference between LocalStorage & SessionStorage</h1>
            <p class="fs-5"> The main difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does
                not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. Here are the features of
                both localStorage & sessionStorage:
            <h5 class="fw-bolder">LocalStorage</h5>
            <ol class="fs-5 mb-4">
                <li class="mb-2">Web storage can be viewed simplistically as an improvement on cookies, providing much
                    greater
                    storage capacity. If you look at the Mozilla source code we can see that 5120KB (5MB which equals
                    2.5 Million chars on Chrome) is the default storage size for an entire domain. This gives you
                    considerably more space to work with than a typical 4KB cookie.</li>
                <li>
                    The data stored in localStorage persists until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and
                    available for all current and future visits to the site.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h5 class="fw-bolder">SessionStorage</h5>
            <ol class="fs-5 mb-4">
                <li class="mb-2">It is similar to localStorage.</li>
                <li>The data is not persistent i.e. data is only available per window (or tab in browsers like Chrome
                    and Firefox). Data is only available during the page session. Changes made are saved and available
                    for the current page, as well as future visits to the site on the same tab/window. Once the
                    tab/window is closed, the data is deleted.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <h1 class="fs-2 mb-4">Question 2: Difference between Global Scope & Block Scope</h1>
            <h4 class="fw-bold">Global Scope:</h4>
            <p class="fs-5">
                A variable declared at the top of a program or outside of a function is considered a global scope
                variable. It is a good practice to avoid using global variables because the value of a global variable
                can change in different areas in the program. It can introduce unknown results in the program.
            </p>

            <h4 class="fw-bold">Block Scope:</h4>
            <p class="fs-5">
                This scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific block, from access by the outside
                of the block. The let & const keyword facilitates the variables to be block scoped. In order to access
                the variables of that specific block, we need to create an object for it. Variables declared with the
                var keyword, do not have block scope.

            <h1 class="fs-2 mb-3">Question 3: How event loop works in JavaScript?</h1>
            <p class="fs-5">The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing
                callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and
                checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits
                for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.

            <h4>Ways that you can get undefined are:</h4>
            <p class="fs-5">
            <ol class="fs-5 mb-4">
                <li>variable that is not initialized will give undefined.</li>
                <li>function with no return.</li>
                <li>parameter that is not passed will be undefined.</li>
                <li>if return has nothing on the right side will return undefined.</li>
                <li>property that doesn't exists on an object will give you undefined.</li>
                <li>accessing array elements outside of the index range will give you undefined.</li>
                <li>deleting an element inside an array.</li>
                <li>setting a value directly to undefined</li>
